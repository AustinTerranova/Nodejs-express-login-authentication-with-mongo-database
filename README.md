# Nodejs-express-login-authentication-with-mongo-database
I created this login authentication form with database authentication and browse side sessions as a way to get more familiar with express, nodejs, sesssions and mongodb. I am satisfied with how this went but, I would a lot of changes in the future. In the future I would use routers to break the code up so that is is cleaner. I would also use persistent storage for my sessions
