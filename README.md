# Nodejs-express-login-authentication-with-mongo-database
This project was supposed to be a simple introduction into login authentication for me. I created this login authentication form with database authentication and browse side sessions as a way to get more familiar with <b>express, nodejs, sesssions and mongodb.</b> I am satisfied with how this went but, I would a few changes in the future. In the future, I would use routers to break the code up. I would also use persistent storage for my sessions. I would like to add more security features for example hashing passwords.
